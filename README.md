# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

This repo will contain every snippet of code that pertains to some data structures like the following:
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Arrays (Slice)
- Stacks
- Queues

And overall I wanted to create this so that future Go developers (or even experienced ones) can reference back to this repo and not feel overwhelmed with having to research.

I will continually update this repo as best as I can, but be aware that I am *NOT* a professional developer, just some dude who felt like sharing knowledge.

Thanks :)
